# Loaner
An LLM based application that can understands bulk loan documents and a customer facing prompt environment where a user can talk to the application and identify the perfect loan package for themselves; instead of undergoing the time consuming activity of going through all the documentation.

# Design
⦁	LLM side - regularly read documents, create embeddings, store into a db
⦁	Front end - Whatever works - no one knows front end
⦁	Back end - Python Flask

# Tools
LLM stuff - OpenAI
Front end - No one knows
Backend - Python Flask

# Prioritization
1.	LLM side - 
  1. Local documents reading
  2. Postgres db creation and setup
  3. Connect the LLM to read and write
  2.	Ask chatgpt to create front end
3.	Create back end using Python flask
4.	Connect backend and front end
